cubify - Data Cubes On Steroids
-------------------------------
cubify is a tool that allows you to ingest a csv file to quickly create a data cube.
A data cube organizes your data into dimensions and measures.

From there, you can easily create additional cubes by performing binning and aggregation on the source cube. 
This enables you to very quickly perform analysis, using your favorite machine learning algorithm, or to gather quick insights about your data.
